# Notes: ETL in Python & SQL (VS Code + SQLAlchemy + MySQL) and Airflow Scheduling

This document summarizes the hands-on steps to:
1) Create a SQLAlchemy engine from VS Code and load Excel â†’ MySQL using Pandas, and
2) Schedule the job with Airflow (WSL/Ubuntu), pulling credentials from an Airflow Connection.
